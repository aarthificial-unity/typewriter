# Typewriter

Typewriter is a framework for building context-aware dialogue systems in
[Unity].

The architecture was inspired by solutions from [Firewatch][Firewatch] and [The
Last of Us][TLOU], both of which were based on Valve's [Fuzzy Pattern
Matching][Valve] approach. The basic idea is to model the dialogue as a set of
criteria that have to be met for a given line to occur.

The framework does not make any assumptions about the audiovisual presentation
of the dialogue and can be used for both textual and voice acted games. It is
**not a drop-in solution** but rather a foundation for building your own
systems. Good programming knowledge is necessary to use it.
